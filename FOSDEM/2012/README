In 2012, the videos were recorded by the DebConf video team, with help
from IRILL. Live streaming was done by flumotion.com, who were very
helpful.

The official FOSDEM video team took care of the main tracks, lighting
talks, and the cross-distribution devroom; videos in these rooms are
available under a CC BY-SA 3.0 license:

The actual content of the videos, however, remains copyrighted by the
respective speakers.

Videos in the devrooms directory were not recorded by the FOSDEM video
team, and may therefore be under a different license.

<h2><A href="http://lca2013.linux.org.au">Linux.conf.au 2013</A> Videos</h2>

<P>We've released these videos as quickly as possible so that people can enjoy
the many great talks at LCA this year, and so we can get our rendering gear out
of the venue.  We know some of these may have problems, but most of them are
working and tested.  Please <a href="mailto:av-team@team.linux.conf.au">let us
know</a> if there's anything that is mistitled, short or otherwise incorrect,
as well as the ISP mirror you've downloaded the file from, and we'll deal with
it as soon as possible.</P>

<h1>Encoding is now complete</h1>

<p>As of <b>25th February 2013</b>, all videos are now considered complete and
encoded in OGV, WebM and MP4 formats.  If there are any videos that you think
we've missed, that aren't covered in the errata below, then
<a href="mailto:av-team&#64;team.linux.conf.au">let us know</a> and we'll try
to fix it.</p>

<h2>9th Feb update</h2>
<p>I've re-rendered the folowing videos:</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Bufferbloat from a Plumber's point of view</b></li>
 <li><b>Copyright's dark clounds - Optus vs NRL</b></li>
 <li><b>Designing a verifiable and accessible electronic voting system</b></li>
 <li><b>Future directions for the X window system</b></li>
 <li><b>Openstack on Openstack - a single management API for all your servers</b></li>
 <li><b>Teaching robotics and embedded computing with legos and arduino</b></li>
 <li><b>The Perl Rennaisance</b></li>
 <li><b>The Raspberry Pi and Linux</b></li>
 <li><b>The anatomy of a high speed data acquisition system</b></li>
 <li><b>Using open source in over 1,100 schools in New Zealand</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these were cut short either because of render node failure or
because, for reasons I don't yet understand, the cut list in veyepar had
nonsensical cuts in it - using only 0:0:02 to 0:0:04 of a 47 minute video, for
example.  Hopefully this has resolved those problems; others, such as the
speaker's lapel microphone cutting out in the Bufferbloat talk and getting only
the room audio (which is still audible if soft), there's nothing I can do about
- sorry :-)</p>

<h2>14th Feb update</h2>
<p>The following videos have been re-rendered (in both ogv and mp4).</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Beyond Alt Text - What every project should know about Accessibility</b></li>
 <li><b>An Introduction to Linux IPC Facilities</b></li>
 <li><b>Ain't No Party Like A Unix Party</b></li>
 <li><b>Teaching Robotics and Embedded Computing with Legos and Arduino</b></li>
 <li><b>Realtime Response on Multicore systems: It Is Bigger Than I Thought</b></li>
 <li><b>Linux Gaming at Last: Tuning Open Source Graphics Drivers for Valve Software</b></li>
 <li><b>Free and open source software and activism</b></li>
 <li><b>Droids that talk: Pairing Codec2 and Android</b></li>
 <li><b>redgrep: from regular expression derivatives to LLVM</b></li>
 <li><b>Building Persona: federated and privacy-sensitive identity for the Web</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I've also rendered the video for the <B>Cloud Infrastructure</B>, <B>Linux
Security</B>, the <B>Arduino Miniconf</B>, and most of the <B>Systems
Administration</B> minconf talks on Monday.</p>

<h2>17th February update</h2>
<p>I've fixed a few render failures:</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Fun with Gstreamer Pipelines!</b></li>
 <li><b>Geeks Rule Over Kings - the Distributed Democracy</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I've also finished Monday's miniconf talks and the <b>Open Government</b>
Tuesday miniconf.</p>

<h2>24th February update</h2>
<p>All the Miniconf video is now rendered.  I'm still waiting on permission
from Denise to release the Impostor Syndrome talk complete - she may prefer to
only release her talk and not the audience participation section at the end.
The rest are now on the mirrors.  I've also fixed the following problems:</p>
<ul>
 <li><B>Ain't No Party Like A Unix Party</B>, <B>Vampire Mice - how USB PM
 Affects You</B> and <B>Userspace Networking - Fact or Fiction</B> are now
 the correct talks with the correct label.  The <B>Touch And Go</B> talk did
 not occur.</li>
 <li><B>Remedies For Frustration With Speed, Quality and Reviews</B> is now
 correctly labeled (was labeled as 3D Printing with Repsnapper).</li>
 <li><b>Making RCU respect your device's battery lifetime</b> is actually
 <b>Maximum Clojure Performance</B> (Thanks Rob Foehl and others).  It looks
 like the video for the room MCC1 during this talk was accidentally copied
 into the folder for MCC2 and we didn't notice this when marking up the video.
 </li>
 <li><B>Git: not just for source code anymore</B> started early and ended
 early.  This is now fixed and re-encoded.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've also started producing WebM files, and will be gradually working
through producing that format for the rest of the conference.  I've also
marked up and encoded the Linux Australia AGM.</p>

<h2>28th February update</h2>
<p>We've got permission to release the video of the Overcoming Impostor
Syndrome talk; we wanted to make sure that Denise and other people were
comfortable that the audience participation section at the end wasn't
inadvertently leaving anyone in the audience exposed or discredited, and that
it was OK according to our diversity and fairness guidelines.  Everyone is
happy with it, so it's released to the world :-)</p>

<p>All WebM video is now rendered and released.  As a last challenge to myself
I looked at actually adding the metadata we put in the Ogg videos - author,
title, organization, date and location - into the WebM and MP4.  However,
despite using the correct (AFAICS) values of the <b>-metadata</b> keyword, VLC
and Mplayer both show no values for any of the metadata I'm putting in there,
so unless someone can tell me how to set that from an ffmpeg command line, I'm
going to leave it as Will Not Fix.</p>

<h2>Things we can't fix:</h2>
<ul>

 <li><B>Sir Tim Berners-Lee's keynote</B> on Friday and <B>DSD and Open Source</B>
  on Wednesday.  We don't have permission to record the video for those talks.
  Sorry, if you weren't there, you've missed it :-)</li>

 <li><B>Linux Gaming At Last - Tuning Open Source Graphics Drivers for Valve
 Software</B> (ogv) - seems to skip at about 0:12:39 and resolve the problem
 soon after (thanks Phil Ingram).  This problem appears in the original
 source video and there doesn't seem to be much we can do about it.  Sorry -
 Paul, 24/2/13</li>

 <li><B>Crowdsourcing Upstream Refactoring</B> - the audio for this talk starts
 with crackling and no speech, and then comes good after around 0:07:44.
 There's not much we can do about this, but most of the talk is good so I'm
 putting it out as is.</li>

 <li><B>Stereoscopic film making and Linux</B> - it exhibits the same skipping
 problem as the Linux Gaming talk.  There doesn't seem to be anything we can
 do about this.  Sorry - Paul, 24/2/13</li>

 <li><B>Building a slide guitar</B> - this is a great video of a bunch of
 people huddling in a corner.  There's no audio and the video is almost
 useless.  I've decided not to encode this - Paul, 24/2/13.</li>

 <li><B>Tracking Vulnerable JARs</B> - unfortunately it looks like the
 recording didn't start until half-way through this talk.  I've apologised
 to the person who gave it; there's nothing I can do - Paul, 24/2/13.</li>

 <li><B>Less flack, moar hack!</B> - the audio cuts out from 0:04:45 to 0:07:17
 and from 0:17:11 to 0:18:08 - this looks like it was associated with the video
 feed cutting over.  Most of the talk is usable so I've left it intact.  I
 don't know why that's happened but it's that way in the source, and there's
 nothing we can do about it.  Sorry - Paul, 24/2/13.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Videos we know have problems but will fix:</h2>
<ul>

 <li><B>Bdale Garbee's Keynote on Monday</B> - missing.  Unfortunately our
 video capture system failed on us and we captured this on four DV tapes.
 I've got the 32GB of video of this on a hard disk, and I've cut together a
 full video in PiTiVi but it seems to refuse to render it.  I will be trying
 Cinelerra to see if that works, or if restarting my PiTiVi project from
 scratch fixes it.  I've started work on this as of 25/02/2012 and will
 hopefully have something within two weeks - Paul.</li>

</ul>

<P>Thanks to everyone who's reported problems.  The overall response to getting
the videos up quickly rather than perfectly has been very positive - thanks for
your support!</P>
